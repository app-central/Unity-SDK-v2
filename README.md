# Unity-SDK-v2
Refurbishing the Unity SDK as a UPM package


- Open Unity project
- "Window/General/Services/In App Purchasing"
- Click the "Off" button to turn it on (Yes, that's stupid UX)
- "Install Latest Version"
- "Import"
- An installer should pop out. Confirm everything.
- Open Package Manager
- Click the + button
- "Add Package from Git URL"
- Enter the Git URL from the AppCentral SDK repository
